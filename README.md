# R Project - Austin TX Animal Shelter EDA
 This R project was done back in 2022 as my first EDA project using the program Rstudio. 

 Today's date when adding this project into Git hub is 02/22/2024 and as I reflect and look back at this project I am extremely impressed with the work that I put into this project. The only thing that was left from this project would be the concluding findings to sum up everything.

 The thing about working with a language such as R, Python, SQL and the like, if you don't continue to practice and consistently work on your code, you will lose all that information. I haven't worked with R in quiet sometime, but I remember the fun I had with this project. I have been told R and Python are very similar but have their own strengths and weaknesses. To say If I would relearn R is hard due to the popularity that Python has gained up until this point. So if this becomes the only project that I do within R then so be it, I will continue the legacy of EDA with my new found knowledge and understanding of Python when the time comes to learn and work through.

 This project I will say that I am very proud of because it was in the very beginning of my journey into Data and Data Analytics. Working with animals, dogs in particular, was where my first career out of college began, So i thought it would be fitting do work on a dataset that was on something that I have interest and curiosity in. This dataset was found in Kaggle and unfortunantly I cannot find the user who first imported this dataset file. 

 I do plan to, at some point finish and polish out this project to fix any errors and misspellings that I mostlikely made 2 years ago. And by doing so, hopefully this will respark the love I had when creating this project to begin with. 

 I made this public because I always have so much to learn and would love guidance in any way. If you made it this far, thank you and hope that you find my findings a bit insightful.

 And if you plan to make contributions and edits, know that they are all welcome and hope to be at a level to do the same for others. Thank you!
